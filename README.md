# 2025 SIOP Machine Learning Competition

The 2025 Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP) Machine Learning Competition challenged teams to develop AI-powered "job candidates" capable of presenting themselves as ideal applicants across various preemployment assessments, including personality tests, cognitive ability exams, and interview questions.

## Competition Overview

Teams were tasked with using AI to automatically generate responses to job application questions. The competition aimed to examine how vulnerable common preemployment assessments are to being "gamed" by AI and to help assessment developers adapt to this evolving technology landscape.

## Data & Task

Competitors received:
- A spreadsheet with job descriptions
- A spreadsheet with candidate questions for each job

Teams needed to develop solutions that could automatically complete responses using AI tools (generative AI, supervised learning, or other automated approaches).

## Scoring System

Submissions were evaluated on three key attributes:
- Personality (33.3%)
- Cognitive Ability (33.3%)
- Skills and Ability (33.3%)

A honesty detection system was implemented to identify unrealistic or fake responses.

**Scoring Formula:**
`Job Applicant Score = Honesty * [(Personality * 0.333) + (CognitiveAbility * 0.333) + (SkillsandAbility * 0.333)]`

## Winners

### First Place: Wonderlic ML (Code)
- Guglielmo Menchetti, Lea Cleary, Michael Grossenbacher, Tonya Lucas, Craig Dawson
- Final Score = 0.89

### Second Place: Hungry Llama (Code)
- Shane Halder, Joe Lchman, Jen Gibson, Nick McCann
- Final Score = 0.764

### Third Place: Care Mice (Code)
- Matthew Arsenault, Farshad Koohifar, Suhas Yogish
- Final Score = 0.760

### Fourth Place: ReLULU (Code)
- Bao Ho, Yizhen Egyn Zhu
- Final Score = 0.73
